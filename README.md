"A 3D LABEL STEREO MATCHING METHOD USING UNDERWATER ENERGY FUNCTION"



This project shows the binocular data set collected in the shallow sea scene and the three-dimensional grid of the corresponding object. The observation distance between the target object and the camera is 1 meter, and the target object is 1 meter from the water surface. The scene in the field of vision can be seen clearly under the sunlight, so the experiment is carried out under natural light without needing its own light source. The image size is 1920 x 1080 pixels, and a three-dimensional grid of objects is captured in the air using the Kinect depth camera.

The camera calibration image is in the calib_image folder, the calibration result after using Matlab binocular calibration software is in the calib_result folder, the three-dimensional truth mesh is in the mesh folder, the binocular video in the shallow sea scene can be downloaded through [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OqR6EISER17SoDXuTvZOWQdHainxEvHe/view?usp=drive_link), and the captured image is in the image folder.
